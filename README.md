# Dear Data 100 – Daily Calorie Intake

This Processing sketch visualises 100+ observations of my daily calorie intake over time.

The data was collected using the iOS Notes app and later formatted into a CSV file.

## What the sketch shows
- A red line representing total calories per day  
- Coloured points indicating calorie ranges  
  - Green = low (<500)  
  - Blue = medium (500–1500)  
  - Black = high (>1500)

The axes, spacing, and labels are kept simple so the overall pattern of fluctuation is easy to see.

## How to run
1. Download this repository  
2. Open the folder in **Processing**  
3. Make sure the CSV file is inside the sketch folder  
4. Run `sketch.pde`

## AI Assistance Note
I used ChatGPT as a support tool while working on this project.  
It helped me with:
- clarifying Processing syntax  
- suggesting example code for loading my CSV file  
- giving advice on colours and layout based on my own design choices  

All data collection, topic choice, visual decisions, and the final sketch output are my own.  
I tested, modified, and adapted the code myself to fit my dataset.
